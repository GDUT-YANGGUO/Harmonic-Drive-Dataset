We will release the first fault dataset for harmonic drives used in industrial robots, which includes the setup of the experimental platform and the composition of the multimodal fault dataset. The data is sourced from the front lines of enterprises, making it particularly valuable. This dataset will greatly facilitate further research by providing significant convenience to researchers. Dataset is available at https://github.com/GDUTYANGGUO/Harmonic-Drive-Dataset.
