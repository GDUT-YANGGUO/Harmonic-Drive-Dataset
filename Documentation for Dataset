IV. HARMONIC DRIVES DATASET 
A. Experimental Setup
The experimental setup for fault diagnosis of harmonic drives used in industrial robots, as shown in Fig. 3, includes the following measuring instruments: SKF vibration analyzer, handheld vibration analyzer, wire-type analyzer for motion accuracy measurement, high-precision Renishaw laser tracker, and a certain model of servo drive supporting data read/write. In the experiments, in addition to collecting vibration signals under various working conditions, multimodal signals from the servo drive system itself were also collected, including position command value, actual position value, actual position following error value, actual speed feedback value, feedforward speed command value, torque command value, actual torque observation value, and torque current command value.

B. Dataset Description
The harmonic drive dataset is composed of five different experimental datasets, with each briefly introduced as follows:
1)	The dataset of Experiment 1 consists of vibration data under 12 different working conditions for various normal or faulty harmonic drives. These products were identified and labeled by the quality control department of an industrial robot manufacturer through standard testing procedures. The health state dataset of the harmonic drives is shown in Table IV.
TABLE IV
HEALTH STATE DATASET OF HARMONIC DRIVES
Label	Health Description	Motor Speed (r/min)	Load (kg)	Number of Training Samples	Number of Testing Samples
0	Normal	4985/3739/2492/1247	0/3/8	2945	820
1	Abnormal	4985/3739/2492/1247	0/3/8	755	310
In Table IV, normal data under different speed and load conditions are classified as category 0, while abnormal data under various working conditions are classified as category 1.
2)	The dataset of Experiment 2 consists of 6 different types of fault data occurring under various testing conditions. The collected vibration signals are labeled, as shown in Table V.

Class Label	Description of various health status signals
0	Normal and noise<78db under various working conditions
1	Jitter and noise>78db under 0kg&H speed condition
2	Jitter and noise>78db under 3kg&H speed condition
3	Jitter and noise>78db under 8kg&H speed condition
4	Severe jitter and noise>78db under 0kg&S speed condition
5	Jitter and noise>78db under 3kg&M speed condition
6	Jitter and noise>78db under 3kg&S speed condition
3)	The dataset of Experiment 3 consists of normal samples and various types of single fault and compound fault samples with abnormal vibration signals, as shown in Table VI.

Dataset	Speed	Label	Number of Samples
Training Dataset	L/M/H/S	Normal/Fault 1/Fault 2/Fault 3	2850/2850/2850/2850
Testing Dataset	L/M/H/S	Normal/Fault 1/Fault 2/Fault 3/Fault 1&2/Fault 1&3/Fault 2&3/Fault 1&2&3	1425/1425/1425/1425/1425/1425/1425/1425
The training dataset consists of normal samples and various single-label faults (Fault 1, Fault 2, Fault 3). The testing dataset under different operating conditions includes normal, single fault, double-label compound fault (Fault 1&2, Fault 1&3, Fault 2&3), and triple-label compound fault samples (Fault 1&2&3). As a result, there are four health state categories in the training dataset and eight health state categories in the testing dataset.
4)	The dataset of Experiment 4 consists of 6000 samples of servo system signals (motor current, torque, etc.) from harmonic drives, with 4000 samples in the training dataset containing various health states (including both labeled and unlabeled samples). The proportion of labeled samples in the training dataset is 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%. The testing dataset consists entirely of unlabeled samples, with 2000 mixed samples of various health states, as shown in Table VII.

Testing Dataset	Normal, Fault 1, Fault 2, Fault 3	Unlabeled	2000
5)	The dataset of Experiment 5 includes vibration signals and various servo signals. The number of servo signal samples is 1700, 1600, 5000, and 5150, respectively. The ratio of samples in the training dataset to the testing dataset is 7:3. The experimental conditions are as follows: 1) Training and testing using only servo signals, only vibration signals, and both servo and vibration signals. 2) Training using both servo and vibration signals, but testing using only servo signals. 3) Training and testing using both servo and vibration signals. The details are shown in Table VIII.
